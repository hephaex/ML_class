# 온수당 Machine Learing Note (week #6)
* Advice for applying machine learning
* progress: 6 주차
*
* date: 2016.05.31

* Note:
 - 1주와 2주는 supervised learing 에서 Linear Regression(선형 회귀)을 공부했습니다.
 - 3주는 classification(군집화)에 대하여 공부했습니다.
 - 4주는 기계학습에서 사용하는 신경망(neural network)을 공부했습니다.
 - 5주는 신경망이 어떻게 학습을 하는지에 대하여 공부합니다.
 - 5주차 이후 중간 복습하는 시간을 가졌습니다. 
 - 6주차에서는 기계학습에 도움될 여러가지 것을 공부합니다.
